[Marimo](https://marimo.io/) is an open-source reactive notebook for Python â€” reproducible, git-friendly, SQL built-in, executable as a script, and shareable as an app. It provides a user interface for interaction with databases, along with options to integrate the notebook with variety of language model providers (Limited resources are available to support such a workflow due to technical and cost constraints in DataHub).


The application can be run from Jupyter Lab's launcher.
