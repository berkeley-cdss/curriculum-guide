## Spread the Word

We are always interested in getting case studies of how different teaching teams used their hub and tweaked it according to their needs. So reach out to [Eric Van Dusen](mailto:ericvd@berkeley.edu) or [Balaji Alwar](mailto:balajialwar@berkeley.edu) if you are interested in sharing your experience using hub over the past semesters!
