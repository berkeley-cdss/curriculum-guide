## DataHub

### GitHub Issues

The best way for instructional staff to request help with DataHub is through filing a [GitHub issue](github.md).

### Slack Channel

If you have anything you'd like to discuss with the infrastructure team, please join the #ucb-datahubs channel in at [uctech.slack.com](http://uctech.slack.com/). Anyone with a berkeley.edu account can get in.

### DataHub Service Lead

Reach out to [Balaji Alwar](mailto:balajialwar@berkeley.edu) directly if there are time-sensitive issues.

### Announcements

We are trying to build a cadence by sending public announcements about feature releases or version upgrades in the upcoming months. Watch for emails from the datahub-announce list.

You can track our current priorities for this project on our [sprint board](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/projects).

## Modules and Connectors

You can connect with the Modules and Connectors teams via [Slack](http://uctech.slack.com/) or email. [Eric Van Dusen](mailto:ericvd@berkeley.edu) is a good first contact.
