# Connector Associates

Connector associates \(CA\) are focused on supporting the needs of the connector instructor. Unlike module developers who are focused on producing content for courses before classes begin, the core task of CA is to assist with day to day operations of the connector course.

CAs will utlize Github, nbgitpuller Links, and Jupyterhub to support the distribution of course materials.
