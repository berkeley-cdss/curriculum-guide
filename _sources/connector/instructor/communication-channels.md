# Communication Channels

<!--

### Piazza

We have set up a [Piazza site](https://piazza.com/berkeley/other/cs97) for any dicussion related to connectors. This page is for connector instructors and connector assistants \(CAs\) to post questions and concerns they may have. CDSS staff members are regularly monitoring this page and will respond promptly. We are using Piazza instead of email so that communication is open and information is not confined to a private email thread. You also do not have to worry about figuring out who to email. Just post on Piazza and the right person will get back to you!

### Biweekly Instructor Meetings

We will be holding connector instructor meetings every two weeks. These meetings are announced through the mailing list. We will post notes for those who are not able to attend. These meetings will focus on topics that are of interest to the connector instructors.

### Mailing List

You should have been added to the connector instructor mailing list/google group. If you are not sure whether you have been added, you can view all your memberships at [groups.google.com](/groups.google.com). To email all instructors on the mailing list, you can send an email to [ds-connector-instructors@lists.berkeley.edu](mailto:ds-connector-instructors@lists.berkeley.edu).
