# Jupyter Notebooks

## What are Jupyter Notebooks?

Jupyter notebooks are a tool used for in-browser computing that allow you to include code, text, and visualizations on the same page. Once created, these notebooks can be distributed to students and then downloaded in various formats for submission. You can see an example of a Data 8 notebook [here](http://datahub.berkeley.edu/user-redirect/interact?repo=data8assets&path=materials/sp17/lab/lab01\). The link might take some time to download all of the files. Once you see a page of many files, click on the file called `lab01.ipynb`. This is the Jupyter notebook assignment.
