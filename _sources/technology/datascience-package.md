# datascience package

## What is the datascience package?

The `datascience` Python package was written for use in Berkeleyâ€™s Data Science courses and contains useful functionality for investigating and graphically displaying data. One key component of the `datascience` package is the Tables abstraction, which is similar to a Pandas dataframe. The package also contains useful functionality for drawing maps and plotting. The aim of this package is to provide a simple but powerful set of tools for introductory students.
