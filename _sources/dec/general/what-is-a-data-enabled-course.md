# What is a Data-Enabled Course?

A Data-Enabled Course \(DEC\) is a semester-long course exploring higher-level data-driven methods in a particular domain. DECs enable students with basic data science experience to expand and apply their skills in their chosen field.

Some DECs are adapted from existing courses to use data science pedagogy throughout. Others are created from the ground up. In either case, a CDSS curriculum development team partners with faculty to create the necessary in-class exercises, homeworks, labs, and other materials.

## Prerequisites

DECs typically require Data 8 as a prerequisite. Instructors may also recommend or require other foundational math, statistics, or computer science courses, as well as the necessary domain-specific courses.
