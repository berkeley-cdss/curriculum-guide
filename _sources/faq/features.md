Have suggestions on new ways to improve our offering? If yes, read below!

```

**How do I raise a new requirement for the hub?**

We are always open to new ways of supporting the campus community using Datahub. If you have a new requirement, Raise a new GitHub issue using this [link](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+enhancement&template=featurerequest.md). Follow the steps outlined as part of the template to make a case for this enhancement.

**Where will I get updates/notifications about the Datahub feature releases?**

We are trying to build a cadence by sending public announcements about feature releases or version upgrades in the upcoming months. So do watch out for emails from the datahub-announce list!

**How can I collaborate with other users on a notebook at the same time?**

We don't have options to collaborate with other users using any of our hubs at this juncture. However, we are working towards integrating collaborative computing experience through Jupyterhub's [Retrolab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/retrolab) functionality.

**How can I contribute to the open source community building this tool?**

Thanks for thinking about contributing to this amazing community. Reach out to us! You can get a sense of how to contribute to Datahub by reading this [link](https://docs.datahub.berkeley.edu/en/latest/admins/pre-reqs.html).
