**How do I spread the word about the hub?**

We are always interested in getting case studies of how different teaching teams used their hub and tweaked it according to their needs. So reach out to [Eric Van Dusen](mailto:ericvd@berkeley.edu)/[Balaji Alwar](mailto:balajialwar@berkeley.edu) if you are interested in sharing your experience using hub over the past semesters!

**What are the collaterals that I can use to share the information about this initiative?**

- Anyone interested to know more about Data initiatives at Berkeley, can take a look at Computing, Data Science and Society's (CDSS) [website](https://data.berkeley.edu/external).

- [Data science modules](https://ds-modules.github.io/) are short explorations into data science that give students the opportunity to work hands-on with a data set relevant to their course and receive some instruction on the principles of data analysis, statistics, and computing. Here is the [link](https://github.com/ds-modules) to DS-Modules repository which has information on the many courses using it at Berkeley. Reach out to Eric Van Dusen (ericvd@berkeley) if you want help to make notebooks.

- Otter Grader is a light-weight, modular open-source autograder developed by the Data Science Education Program at UC Berkeley. If you are interested to learn more about this autograding software then check this link [here](https://otter-grader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

- If you are interested to learn more about the conversations by the Jupyter Hub community, then check the discourse [link](https://discourse.jupyter.org/)

- If you are thinking about setting up a JupyterHub distribution for a small number of users (around 100) on a single server, then check out [The Littlest JupyterHub](https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/)
